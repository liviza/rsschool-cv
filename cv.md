My next goal is to get a job as a junior front-end developer. To do this, I need to learn JavaScript and the React framework, and also upgrade my skills in CSS. I consider high learning ability, focus on results and the ability to work to deadlines as my strengths.
At my previous job, I organized business conferences. Now I have an analytical work in the same area.
